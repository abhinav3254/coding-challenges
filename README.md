# LeetCode Problems  
 
This repository focuses on solving LeetCode problems. Anyone is welcome to take on and submit their solution to a problem. This repository was made by Alejandro Medina (@alejmedinajr) in the summer of 2022 because coding is fun!

### How to participate?

1. First you will need to create a new branch. This new branch should be called dev_X, where the X is replaced by whatever you want.
2. After creating your own branch, you can assign yourself to any open or closed issue. These issues are created based on the questions from the website, and they even include the link to the website where the question can be found. If you create your own issue, please follow the format of already existing issues! 
3. Closed issues only means one solution has been found, you can always try to find a different solution. Who knows, your solution may even be better!
4. If you prefer another language, feel free to create a new issue with the same problem. Just add a tag for the language your solution will be in!
5. When you complete a challenge, you can commit your code (you might want to make sure it works though!) 
6. If you contribute anything, add yourself to the contributers list at the bottom of this README file!
7. Your commits will be updated to the master branch as soon as humanly possible! You will also be mentioned in issue thread as someone who has a potential solution (incase anyone else working on the problem wants to ask you for your expertise!)
### How should code be styled?

1. When creating a solution, you should name the file with the LeetCode problem number, followed by an underscore and name of the problem itself.
2. In your solution, you should have class level comments that have: 
      - the problem description
      - your name and github username
      - a link to the problem on  [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
3. Commenting your code is optional
4. Syntax and how you do it is also entirely up to you!
